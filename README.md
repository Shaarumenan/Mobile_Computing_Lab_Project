Title : Live Location Track using Google Maps API & Firebase

We developed a app to track live location and store it in real time database which updates it frequently, using Android Studio for developing and Google maps API for Displaying Location and Google Firebase for Storing and Update. We simulated a scenario of moving Location by spoofing our GPS location using third-party location spoofer app named - Fake GPS.We can use any third-part spoof app.

We included our app's apk file. We also provided Source code to our app and Screenshots of real time database.

We also included a Screen Record of our app in function.
